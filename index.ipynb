    "This project aims to develop a predictive model that can forecast hotel booking cancellations based on historical data. The model will be trained [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset) obtained from Kaggle, which contains a large number of hotel reservations made by customers. The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a hotel booking being cancelled. This information can be valuable for hotels as it allows them to make informed decisions about their inventory management, staff scheduling, and revenue optimization strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will involve several steps, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The performance of the model will be measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, we will also explore the relationships between different variables and their impact on booking cancellations. This will help us to gain insights into the factors that contribute to cancellations and to identify potential areas for improvement. Overall, this project has the potential to provide valuable insights and practical applications for the hospitality industry. By developing a predictive model that can accurately forecast booking cancellations, hotels can better manage their resources, improve customer satisfaction, and increase revenue."

    "The hospitality industry is a highly competitive market, with hotels constantly striving to optimize their revenue and improve customer satisfaction. One of the major challenges faced by hotels is managing cancellations, which can result in lost revenue and reduced occupancy rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a [recent study](https://www.hotelmanagement.net/tech/study-cancelation-rate-at-40-as-otas-push-free-change-policy), average hotel cancellations have risen to at least 40% of overall bookings. This highlights the need for a predictive model that can accurately forecast booking cancellations. By building a predictive model that can accurately forecast booking cancellations, hotels can take proactive measures to minimize the impact of cancellations on their revenue. For example, they can offer discounts or special promotions to customers who are likely to cancel their bookings, or they can allocate resources more efficiently by adjusting their staff scheduling and inventory management strategies based on the predicted cancellation rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the business value of this project lies in its ability to help hotels improve their revenue optimization strategies, increase customer satisfaction, and reduce the financial impact of booking cancellations. By developing a predictive model that can accurately forecast booking cancellations, hotels can gain a competitive edge in the highly competitive hospitality industry."

    "The dataset includes the following features:\n",
    "- Booking_ID: unique identifier of each booking\n",
    "- no_of_adults: Number of adults\n",

    "- no_of_weekend_nights: Number of weekend nights (Saturday or Sunday) the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel\n",
