    "This project aims to develop a predictive model that can forecast hotel booking cancellations based on historical data. The model will be trained [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset) obtained from Kaggle, which contains a large number of hotel reservations made by customers. The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a hotel booking being cancelled. This information can be valuable for hotels as it allows them to make informed decisions about their inventory management, staff scheduling, and revenue optimization strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will involve several steps, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The performance of the model will be measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, we will also explore the relationships between different variables and their impact on booking cancellations. This will help us to gain insights into the factors that contribute to cancellations and to identify potential areas for improvement. Overall, this project has the potential to provide valuable insights and practical applications for the hospitality industry. By developing a predictive model that can accurately forecast booking cancellations, hotels can better manage their resources, improve customer satisfaction, and increase revenue."
